Load balancer where shut down by an adversary.
OpenStack CLI where not working correctly, as the token did not authorize correctly. Suspect that this is the adversary's doing.
Fixed the problem by clicking on the `Start Instance` button in the OpenStack GUI.


## What can be done to improve further incidents?

Tried to fix OpenStack CLI by loading in a fresh version of the RC File V3 with `scp IMT3003_V18_group21-openrc.sh ubuntu@10.212.136.14:`.
This was a stupid idea because doing this effectively overwrote the password for authentication. There we need a new password before we can resume
doing OpenStack CLI operations...
* This can be mitigated in the future by always having a backup of the IMT3003_V18_group21-openrc.sh file as it should be without tampering.
